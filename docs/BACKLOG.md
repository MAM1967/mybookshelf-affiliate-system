# Project Backlog: MyBookshelf Affiliate System

## Project Status Overview

**Current State**: üîß **BASIC AFFILIATE LINKS WORKING** - Site deployed, links fixed, but missing automation pipeline + proper dev workflow  
**Target**: Full automated affiliate system with LinkedIn integration per PRD  
**Timeline**: Week 1 & 2 implementation plan from PRD  
**Progress**: **~15% Complete** - Basic deployment exists, but missing critical dev infrastructure, testing, automation pipeline, and monitoring

### ‚ö†Ô∏è REALITY CHECK: CURRENT STATE vs PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS

**What We Have:**

- ‚úÖ Basic HTML/CSS/JS frontend deployed to production
- ‚úÖ Supabase database with 4 books
- ‚úÖ Working affiliate links to Amazon
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository with version control

**What We're Missing (CRITICAL):**

- ‚ùå No development or staging environments
- ‚ùå No automated testing of any kind
- ‚ùå No CI/CD pipeline to prevent bugs in production
- ‚ùå No monitoring or error tracking
- ‚ùå No LinkedIn automation or PA API automation
- ‚ùå No environment variable management
- ‚ùå No database migrations or backup strategy
- ‚ùå No performance optimization or caching
- ‚ùå No proper error handling or user feedback

**Risk Assessment:** üî¥ **HIGH RISK** - Current production deployment is fragile and could break easily without proper development practices
