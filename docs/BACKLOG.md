# Project Backlog: MyBookshelf Affiliate System

## Project Status Overview

**Current State**: üîß **BASIC AFFILIATE LINKS WORKING** - Site deployed, links fixed, but missing automation pipeline + proper dev workflow  
**Target**: Full automated affiliate system with LinkedIn integration per PRD  
**Timeline**: Week 1 & 2 implementation plan from PRD  
**Progress**: **~15% Complete** - Basic deployment exists, but missing critical dev infrastructure, testing, automation pipeline, and monitoring

### ‚ö†Ô∏è REALITY CHECK: CURRENT STATE vs PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS

**What We Have:**

- ‚úÖ Basic HTML/CSS/JS frontend deployed to production
- ‚úÖ Supabase database with 4 books
- ‚úÖ Working affiliate links to Amazon
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository with version control

**What We're Missing (CRITICAL):**

- ‚ùå No development or staging environments
- ‚ùå No automated testing of any kind
- ‚ùå No CI/CD pipeline to prevent bugs in production
- ‚ùå No monitoring or error tracking
- ‚ùå No LinkedIn automation or PA API automation
- ‚ùå No environment variable management
- ‚ùå No database migrations or backup strategy
- ‚ùå No performance optimization or caching
- ‚ùå No proper error handling or user feedback

**Risk Assessment:** üî¥ **HIGH RISK** - Current production deployment is fragile and could break easily without proper development practices

  - [ ] Add accessory search functionality (journals, pens)
  - [ ] Create weekly batch fetching (3 books + 1 accessory)

- [ ] **Story**: Smart Amazon Pricing Handler ‚≠ê **UPDATED PRIORITY**

  - [ ] **Problem**: Amazon books have multiple formats (Kindle $9.99, Paperback $14.99, Hardcover $24.99, Audiobook $19.95)
  - [ ] **Business Decision**: Show the cheapest available price as default to maximize user appeal
  - [ ] **User Experience**: Users will make final format decision on Amazon detail page after clicking affiliate link

  **Price Selection Business Logic:**

  - [ ] **Primary Rule**: Display lowest price among all available formats FROM NEW/AMAZON-SOLD items only
  - [ ] **Critical Exclusion**: Never include used books or third-party seller prices (no affiliate compensation)
  - [ ] **Seller Filtering**: Only consider prices from Amazon.com or Amazon-fulfilled sellers
  - [ ] **Format Eligibility**: Include all physical and digital formats (Kindle, Paperback, Hardcover, Audiobook)
  - [ ] **Price Display**: "Starting at $X.XX" with format indicator showing which format has lowest NEW price
  - [ ] **Affiliate Link**: Default link goes to the cheapest NEW format's Amazon page
  - [ ] **Fallback**: If price data unavailable, prioritize: Paperback ‚Üí Kindle ‚Üí Hardcover ‚Üí Audiobook

  **Implementation Tasks:**

  - [ ] **Task**: Parse all available formats from Amazon PA API `Offers.Listings[]`
  - [ ] **Task**: Implement price comparison algorithm with seller filtering
    - [ ] Filter `Offers.Listings[]` to exclude used/third-party sellers
      - [ ] Check `Offers.Listings[].Condition` = "New" only
      - [ ] Verify `Offers.Listings[].Merchant.Name` = "Amazon.com" or is Amazon-fulfilled
      - [ ] Exclude marketplace sellers that don't generate affiliate commissions
    - [ ] Extract price from qualified listings: `Offers.Listings[].Price.Amount`
    - [ ] Convert all prices to consistent currency/decimal format
    - [ ] Find minimum price across all NEW formats only
    - [ ] Identify which format has the minimum NEW price
  - [ ] **Task**: Create price display logic
    - [ ] Show "Starting at $X.XX" with lowest price
    - [ ] Display format badge (e.g., "Kindle", "Paperback", "Hardcover", "Audiobook")
    - [ ] Ensure affiliate link points to cheapest format's Amazon page
  - [ ] **Task**: Add format availability indicator
    - [ ] Show "Multiple formats available" when >1 format exists
    - [ ] Display price range if helpful (e.g., "$9.99 - $24.99")
  - [ ] **Task**: Handle edge cases
    - [ ] No NEW price data available (show "Price varies" or hide item)
    - [ ] Only used/third-party prices available (exclude item from display)
    - [ ] Only one NEW format available (show that format's price)
    - [ ] Temporary price unavailable (fallback to last known NEW price)
    - [ ] Invalid/corrupted price data (skip and use fallback)
    - [ ] All formats are used/marketplace only (do not display item)
  - [ ] **Task**: Format-specific affiliate link management
    - [ ] Generate correct Amazon ASIN-based links for each format
    - [ ] Ensure affiliate tag (`mybookshelf-20`) works for all formats
    - [ ] Test affiliate tracking across different format types
  - [ ] **Task**: UI Enhancement for price display
    - [ ] Update frontend to show "Starting at" pricing
    - [ ] Add format badge styling consistent with site theme
    - [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness for price display

  **Business Impact**: Maximize click-through rates by showing most appealing (lowest) price while ensuring affiliate commission eligibility
  **Revenue Protection**: Exclude used/third-party prices that generate zero affiliate commissions
  **Technical Notes**: PA API returns `Offers.Listings[].Condition` and `Offers.Listings[].Merchant.Name` for seller filtering
  **Priority Justification**: Addresses immediate user question about price display logic and protects affiliate revenue
