## TOP PRIORITY (after approval)

- Complete LinkedIn organization posting integration and test with w_organization_social scope.

## NEXT TECHNICAL PRIORITY - SCALABILITY

### Price Updater Generalization & Scalability

**Priority**: HIGH - **T-Shirt Size**: M (1-2 weeks)

**Problem**: Current price updater system is designed for a specific case of 97 items. As the catalog grows beyond 97 items, the system needs to be more generalized to handle any number of items dynamically.

**Current State**:

- Fixed references to "97 items" in code and documentation
- System assumes specific item count in processing logic
- Not scalable for future catalog expansion

**Required Changes**:

- ✅ **Dynamic Item Counting**: Remove hardcoded references to "97 items"
- ✅ **Scalable Processing**: Ensure system handles 100, 200, 500+ items efficiently
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Implement batching for large catalogs
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Handle large datasets without memory issues
- ✅ **Timeout Management**: Ensure Vercel function limits are respected (5-minute max)
- ✅ **Progress Reporting**: Enhanced logging for larger item sets
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Adaptive delays based on catalog size
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Better handling of failures in large batches

**Technical Specifications**:

- **Target**: Support up to 1,000+ items efficiently
- **Batch Size**: Process items in configurable batches (50-100 items per batch)
- **Timeout Handling**: Graceful handling of Vercel's 5-minute function limit
- **Progress Tracking**: Report progress every 10% completion for large catalogs
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Scale delay times based on total item count

**Implementation Priority**: Address immediately after LinkedIn API approval to ensure system scales with business growth.
