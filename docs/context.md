# MyBookshelf Affiliate System - Status Update (as of July 7, 2025)

## System Overview

- Automates LinkedIn posting of Christian leadership and business books with Amazon affiliate links.
- Uses Supabase for backend data and token storage.
- Uses Resend for email notifications.
- LinkedIn posting automation is scheduled and can be triggered manually.
- **NEW: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server completed** for system monitoring and automation.

## Current State

- **LinkedIn OAuth flow**: Working, new tokens are stored in Supabase.
- **Supabase integration**: Working, tokens and posting status update correctly.
- **Email notifications**: Working (emails may go to spam; SPF/DKIM/DMARC setup recommended for production).
- **Posting automation**: Script runs, finds scheduled books, and marks them as posted in Supabase.
- **LinkedIn API**: Returns 201 and post ID, but posts are not visible on the LinkedIn feed (LinkedIn-side restriction).
- **Manual LinkedIn post**: Made to help establish account trust.
- **MCP Server**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - 8 tools for system monitoring, revenue tracking, and performance metrics.

## LinkedIn API Approval Status

- **Community Management API Request**: Submitted and under review by LinkedIn Developer Support.
- **Current Status**: Engaged with LinkedIn Developer Support for identity verification and website ownership proof.
- **Required Permissions**: `w_organization_social` for organization posting capabilities.
- **Blocking Issue**: LinkedIn posts return 201 success but are not visible on feed until Community Management API approval.
- **Support Engagement**: Actively working with LinkedIn to verify ownership of MyBookShelf company page and website.

## Recent Developments

- **MCP Server Implementation**: Completed comprehensive MCP server with 8 monitoring tools:
  - LinkedIn posting status and visibility tracking
  - Revenue and affiliate link monitoring
  - Approval workflow status
  - Performance metrics and error tracking
  - System health checks
  - Affiliate product management
- Fixed Supabase environment variable issues in Vercel (set as plain values, not secrets).
- Added missing `refresh_token` column to `linkedin_tokens` table.
- Confirmed new tokens are being stored and used.
- Verified that posting automation completes successfully and sends email reports.
- Test suite: Most tests pass, Admin LinkedIn Integration has warnings (no failures).

## Remaining Issue

- **LinkedIn API posts are not visible on the feed, despite 201 Created responses and valid post IDs.**
- App is not in review, has correct permissions, and uses a valid, recently re-authenticated token.
- Manual posts appear on the feed, but API posts do not.
- **Solution**: Awaiting LinkedIn Community Management API approval and identity verification completion.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate**: Complete LinkedIn Developer Support identity verification process.
- **Short-term**: Monitor for Community Management API approval notification.
- **Post-approval**: Launch affiliate system with MCP server monitoring capabilities.
- **Ongoing**: Use MCP server tools to monitor system performance and revenue tracking.
