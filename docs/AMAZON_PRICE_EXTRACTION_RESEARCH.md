# Amazon Price Extraction Research

## üîç **Research Objective**

Find current, proven methods for extracting prices from Amazon product pages before implementing any changes.

## üìä **Current State Analysis**

### **Our Current Approach:**

- 6 regex patterns targeting specific HTML structures
- All patterns failing for 10+ items
- No fallback methods
- No structured data extraction

### **Root Cause Discovered:**

- **Amazon is blocking our requests** and showing CAPTCHA pages
- We're not getting product pages, we're getting verification pages
- This explains why all patterns fail - there's no product content to parse

## üåê **Online Research Sources**

### **1. GitHub Repositories**

- Search for "amazon price scraper" repositories
- Look for recent (2024-2025) implementations
- Analyze successful extraction patterns

### **2. Stack Overflow**

- Search for "amazon price extraction 2024"
- Look for current working solutions
- Check for recent Amazon HTML structure changes

### **3. Web Scraping Communities**

- Reddit r/webscraping
- ScrapingBee, ScrapingAnt documentation
- Proxy providers' Amazon scraping guides

### **4. Amazon Developer Resources**

- Amazon Product Advertising API (if applicable)
- Amazon's structured data documentation
- Official product data feeds

## üî¨ **Research Questions**

### **Technical Questions:**

1. What are the current most reliable price extraction methods?
2. How has Amazon's HTML structure changed in 2024-2025?
3. What fallback methods work when primary extraction fails?
4. Are there any official Amazon data sources we can use?
5. What are the current anti-bot measures (if any) for books?

### **Implementation Questions:**

1. Should we use CSS selectors instead of regex?
2. Is JSON-LD structured data more reliable?
3. What's the success rate of different extraction methods?
4. How do we handle different product types (books vs electronics)?
5. What's the best approach for marketplace vs Amazon direct items?

## üìã **Research Plan**

### **Phase 1: Literature Review (1 hour)**

- [ ] Search GitHub for "amazon price scraper" repositories
- [ ] Find recent Stack Overflow discussions
- [ ] Review web scraping service documentation
- [ ] Check Amazon's official developer resources

### **Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (1 hour)**

- [ ] Analyze successful extraction patterns
- [ ] Compare with our current patterns
- [ ] Identify missing extraction methods
- [ ] Document current Amazon HTML structure

### **Phase 3: Testing & Validation (1 hour)**

- [ ] Test found patterns against our failing items
- [ ] Measure success rates
- [ ] Validate extraction accuracy
- [ ] Performance testing

### **Phase 4: Implementation Planning (30 min)**

- [ ] Choose best extraction methods
- [ ] Plan implementation approach
- [ ] Set success metrics
- [ ] Create deployment strategy

## üéØ **Expected Research Outcomes**

### **What We Hope to Find:**

1. **Current Best Practices**: Most reliable extraction methods
2. **Updated Patterns**: Regex/CSS patterns that work in 2025
3. **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple extraction methods
4. **Performance Data**: Success rates and speed metrics
5. **Anti-Bot Insights**: Current Amazon protection measures

### **What We'll Avoid:**

1. **Outdated Methods**: Patterns from 2020-2023
2. **Unreliable Sources**: Untested or theoretical approaches
3. **Anti-Bot Workarounds**: Methods that might trigger blocks
4. **Complex Solutions**: Over-engineered approaches

## üìä **Success Criteria**

### **Research Quality:**

- [ ] Find at least 5 recent, working implementations
- [ ] Identify patterns with 90%+ success rates
- [ ] Document current Amazon HTML structure
- [ ] Validate findings against our failing items

### **Implementation Readiness:**

- [ ] Have concrete, testable extraction methods
- [ ] Understand current Amazon page structure
- [ ] Know success rates and limitations
- [ ] Have fallback strategies planned
